WOPA the highlight of 2014
WOPA has been an amazing and exciting experience.
I have had an opportunity to make new friends.
Through interactions with the girls, we have been able to
exchange ideas concerning different areas and learn from each other.
The sessions have occupied my free time such that I can now tell
people am “busy” and I feel like I have a purpose in life.
I would like to thank the facilitators for not giving up on us despite
disappointing them on several occasions and giving us feedback that
has helped improve and learn more.
Though of late it has been challenging to balance WOPA, tests and
coursework and exams but I have come too far to give up now. Looking forward to the remaining sessions.
